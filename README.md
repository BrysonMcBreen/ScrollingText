# ScrollingText
C++ Scrolling Text Console Output

## How To Use:
1. go under #define SPEED and change the number to the speed in miliseconds you would like it too output
2. add #include "ScrollingText.h" too whatever file you want to use it in
3. when you want to use it, do scroll([string]); The program will handle the rest :)
